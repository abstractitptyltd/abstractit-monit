###############################################################################
## Global section
###############################################################################
##
## Start Monit in the background (run as a daemon):
#
  set daemon <%= @check_interval %> # check services at 2-minute intervals
<%- if @start_delay -%>
   with start delay <%= @start_delay %>
<%- end -%>
#
## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, Monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to 
## a standalone log file instead, specify the full path to the log file
#
<%- if @logfacility == 'syslog' -%>
  set logfile syslog facility log_daemon                       
<%- else -%>
  set logfile <%= @log_file %>
<%- end -%>

#
## Set the location of the Monit id file which stores the unique id for the
## Monit instance. The id is generated and stored on first Monit start. By 
## default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.id.
#
  set idfile <%= @id_file %>
#
## Set the location of the Monit state file which saves monitoring states
## on each cycle. By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.state. If
## the state file is stored on a persistent filesystem, Monit will recover
## the monitoring state across reboots. If it is on temporary filesystem, the
## state will be lost on reboot which may be convenient in some situations.
#
<%- if @statefile -%>
  set statefile /var/lib/monit/state
<%- end -%>
#
## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be 
## specified using a comma separator. If the first mail server fails, Monit 
# will use the second mail server in the list and so on. By default Monit uses 
# port 25 - it is possible to override this with the PORT option.
#
<%- if @mailserver != '' -%>
set mailserver <%= @mailserver %> #,               # primary mailserver
<%- end -%>
#                backup.bar.baz port 10025,  # backup mailserver on port 10025
#                localhost                   # fallback relay
#
#
## By default Monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available. 
## If you want to keep the alerts for later delivery retry, you can use the 
## EVENTQUEUE statement. The base directory where undelivered alerts will be 
## stored is specified by the BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue
## size using the SLOTS option (if omitted, the queue is limited by space 
## available in the back end filesystem).
#
<%- if @eventqueue -%>
  set eventqueue
      basedir <%= @events_dir %> # set the base directory where events will be stored
      slots <%= @event_slots %>  # optionally limit the queue size
<%- end -%>
#
#
## Send status and events to M/Monit (for more informations about M/Monit 
## see http://mmonit.com/). By default Monit registers credentials with 
## M/Monit so M/Monit can smoothly communicate back to Monit and you don't
## have to register Monit credentials manually in M/Monit. It is possible to
## disable credential registration using the commented out option below. 
## Though, if safety is a concern we recommend instead using https when
## communicating with M/Monit and send credentials encrypted.
#
<%- if @mmonit_collector != '' -%>
 set mmonit <%= @mmonit_collector %>
<%- end -%>
# set mmonit http://monit:monit@192.168.1.10:8080/collector
#     # and register without credentials     # Don't register credentials
#
#
## Monit by default uses the following format for alerts if the the mail-format
## statement is missing::
## --8<--
## set mail-format {
##      from: monit@$HOST
##   subject: monit alert --  $EVENT $SERVICE
##   message: $EVENT Service $SERVICE
##                 Date:        $DATE
##                 Action:      $ACTION
##                 Host:        $HOST
##                 Description: $DESCRIPTION
##
##            Your faithful employee,
##            Monit
## }
## --8<--
##
## You can override this message format or parts of it, such as subject
## or sender using the MAIL-FORMAT statement. Macros such as $DATE, etc.
## are expanded at runtime. For example, to override the sender, use:
#
<%- if @from_email != '' -%>
set mail-format { from: <%= @from_email %> }
<%- end -%>
#
#
## You can set alert recipients whom will receive alerts if/when a 
## service defined in this file has errors. Alerts may be restricted on 
## events by using a filter as in the second example below. 
#
<%- if @alert_email != '' -%>
set alert <%= @alert_email %> # receive all alerts
<%- end -%>
# set alert manager@foo.bar only on { timeout }  # receive just service-
#                                                # timeout alert
#
#
## Monit has an embedded web server which can be used to view status of 
## services monitored and manage services from a web interface. See the
## Monit Wiki if you want to enable SSL for the web server. 
#
<%- if @status_server -%>
set httpd port <%= @status_port %> and
    use address <%= @status_address %>  # only accept connection from localhost
    <%- @status_allow.each do |allow| -%>
    allow <%= allow %>
    <%- end -%>
<%- end -%>

#set httpd port 2812 and
#    use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
#    allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and
#    allow admin:monit      # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
#    allow @monit           # allow users of group 'monit' to connect (rw)
#    allow @users readonly  # allow users of group 'users' to connect readonly

#    
## Check if a file exists, checksum, permissions, uid and gid. In addition
## to alert recipients in the global section, customized alert can be sent to 
## additional recipients by specifying a local alert handler. The service may 
## be grouped using the GROUP option. More than one group can be specified by
## repeating the 'group name' statement.
#    
#  check file apache_bin with path /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
#    if failed checksum and 
#       expect the sum 8f7f419955cefa0b33a2ba316cba3659 then unmonitor
#    if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
#    if failed uid root then unmonitor
#    if failed gid root then unmonitor
#    alert security@foo.bar on {

#    group server
#
#    
## Check that a process is running, in this case Apache, and that it respond
## to HTTP and HTTPS requests. Check its resource usage such as cpu and memory,
## and number of children. If the process is not running, Monit will restart 
## it by default. In case the service is restarted very often and the 
## problem remains, it is possible to disable monitoring using the TIMEOUT
## statement. This service depends on another service (apache_bin) which
## is defined above.
#    
#  check process apache with pidfile /usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid
#    start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start" with timeout 60 seconds

#    if cpu > 60% for 2 cycles then alert
#    if cpu > 80% for 5 cycles then restart
#    if totalmem > 200.0 MB for 5 cycles then restart
#    if children > 250 then restart
#    if loadavg(5min) greater than 10 for 8 cycles then stop
#    if failed host www.tildeslash.com port 80 protocol http

#       then restart
#    if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout
#    depends on apache_bin
#    group server
#    
#    
## Check filesystem permissions, uid, gid, space and inode usage. Other services,
## such as databases, may depend on this resource and an automatically graceful
## stop may be cascaded to them before the filesystem will become full and data
## lost.
#
#  check filesystem datafs with path /dev/sdb1
#    start program  = "/bin/mount /data"
#    stop program  = "/bin/umount /data"
#    if failed permission 660 then unmonitor
#    if failed uid root then unmonitor
#    if failed gid disk then unmonitor
#    if space usage > 80% for 5 times within 15 cycles then alert
#    if space usage > 99% then stop
#    if inode usage > 30000 then alert
#    if inode usage > 99% then stop
#    group server
#
#
## Check a file's timestamp. In this example, we test if a file is older 
## than 15 minutes and assume something is wrong if its not updated. Also,
## if the file size exceed a given limit, execute a script
#
#  check file database with path /data/mydatabase.db
#    if failed permission 700 then alert
#    if failed uid data then alert
#    if failed gid data then alert
#    if timestamp > 15 minutes then alert
#    if size > 100 MB then exec "/my/cleanup/script" as uid dba and gid dba
#
#
## Check directory permission, uid and gid.  An event is triggered if the 
## directory does not belong to the user with uid 0 and gid 0.  In addition, 
## the permissions have to match the octal description of 755 (see chmod(1)).
#
#  check directory bin with path /bin
#    if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
#    if failed uid 0 then unmonitor
#    if failed gid 0 then unmonitor
#
#
## Check a remote host availability by issuing a ping test and check the 
## content of a response from a web server. Up to three pings are sent and 
## connection to a port and an application level network check is performed.
#
#  check host myserver with address 192.168.1.1
#    if failed icmp type echo count 3 with timeout 3 seconds then alert
#    if failed port 3306 protocol mysql with timeout 15 seconds then alert
#    if failed url http://user:password@www.foo.bar:8080/?querystring
#       and content == 'action="j_security_check"'
#       then alert
